countLeaves t - countNodes t = 1

- Base case

   countLeaves (Leaf n) - countNodes (Leaf n)
=     { applying countLeaves }
   1 - countNodes (Leaf n)
=     { applying countNodes }
   1 - 0
=     { applying - }
   1


- Inductive case

   countLeaves (Node l r) - countNodes (Node l r)
=     { applying countLeaves }
   (countLeaves l + countLeaves r) - countNodes (Node l r)
=     { applying countNodes }
   (countLeaves l + countLeaves r) - (countNodes l + countNodes r + 1)
=     { induction hypothesis for l }
   1 + countLeaves r - countNodes r - 1
=     { induction hypothesis for r }
   1 + 1 - 1
=     { applying + and - }
   1
